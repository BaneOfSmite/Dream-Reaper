# Dream-Reaper

This is a 2D action RPG game. You will choose a weapon when you first start the game in a map we call Town. Next you will head down to a forest map and fight the slimes with the weapon you have chosen and if you defeat this stage, you will head down to a castle map where you fight the final boss. During any scenario where you die, you will be teleported to a map called the graveyard where you will fight the graveyard boss. If you defeat the graveyard boss, you will become stronger and spawn at the place you last died.

Source Code & Exe is in releases.
